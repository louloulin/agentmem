## Version History

- **7.0.0** (2025-09-30): Tool execution, observability, type hints
- **6.0.0** (2024-12-01): Initial release

## Migration Guides

### Migrating from 6.x to 7.x

Version 7.0.0 is fully backward compatible with 6.x. All existing code will continue to work without changes.

To use new features:

```python
# Tool execution (new in 7.0)
from agentmem.tools import ToolExecutor, ToolSchema, ToolParameter

executor = ToolExecutor()
# ... register and execute tools

# Observability (new in 7.0)
from agentmem.observability import MetricsCollector, PerformanceTracker

metrics = MetricsCollector()
tracker = PerformanceTracker()
# ... collect metrics and track performance
```

No breaking changes were introduced in 7.0.0.
